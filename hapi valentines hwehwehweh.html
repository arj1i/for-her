                    <span>
                        &emsp;  Happy Valentine's Ja! I couldn't afford to take you out today or even give you something due to my hectic schedule, but I still want to take this chance to remind you how much you mean to me. Every moment that I spent with you felt special. We had difficult times, but I am glad we overcame all that.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  So now, I want to express my gratitude for what we currently have. Talking with you makes my day better, like a lot. There are times when, no matter how exhausting my day has been, just a moment with you makes it all worthwhile. Sharing my day with you and hearing from you is one of the best parts of my day. And just the thought of you eases the weight of my day. I will forever thank our Lord for letting you come into my life Ja.
                    <br> <br>
                    </span>
                        &emsp;  Back then, I said that I'd think about my decision about what we have right now. So now, I'll take this chance to let you know that I will be pursuing you once more, but now, just as we discussed, let us let our Lord take the lead. Thank you Ja, for helping me bring myself closer to Him. I am grateful because I get to cherish what we have, so I will not worry anymore. I am hopeful, and I root for both of us Ja.
